-Files :
	We can create a file in 3 different modes.
	1.Write
	2.Read
	3.Append

Write : If the file exists then it will overwrite, otherwise it will create a new file and add the contents

	Example:
		with open("firstfile.txt", 'w') as fh:
    			fh.write(f"Hello, Good Morning \ni am writing the second line \n")
		

Read : Here the file will be opened only for reading purpose. We cannot modify the file contents.

Append : If the file exists it will add the contents at the end of the file, if the file does not exist then it will create a new file and add the contents
	Example : 	
			fruit_list=["Apple","Orange","Banana"]
			with open("firstfile.txt", 'a') as fh:
    				for fruit in fruit_list:
						fh.write(f"{fruit} \n") #\n to move the filepointer to new line
