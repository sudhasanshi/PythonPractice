-Files :
	We can create a file in 3 different modes.
	1.Write
	2.Read
	3.Append

Write : If the file exists then it will overwrite, otherwise it will create a new file and add the contents

	Example:
		with open("firstfile.txt", 'w') as fh:
    			fh.write(f"Hello, Good Morning \ni am writing the second line \n")
		

Read : Here the file will be opened only for reading purpose. We cannot modify the file contents.

Append : If the file exists it will add the contents at the end of the file, if the file does not exist then it will create a new file and add the contents
	Example : 	
			fruit_list=["Apple","Orange","Banana"]
			with open("firstfile.txt", 'a') as fh:
    				for fruit in fruit_list:
						fh.write(f"{fruit} \n") #\n to move the filepointer to new line

Assignment : Write a script to read the notice, license file and add the content of each file to the file notice_license.txt. The notice or license file may be started with notice or license
Before appending the content to notice_license.txt file add the relative path --> This can also be said as the automation script. Add this to the automation scripts question

To fetch notice and license file from project directory (notice.txt, license.txt, notice.md etc) and the add the contents of this file along with relative path to the single file.
Purpose of writing this script ->  For internal usage
