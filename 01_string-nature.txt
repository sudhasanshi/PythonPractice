String are immutable in nature in python

this means that you cannot change the value of a string once it is created.
ex if you have a string s = "Hello", you can not do s[0] = "M" to change it to "Mello". You can only do s = "Mello" to assign a new string to s.

dictionaries, and sets, which are mutable. You can change the elements of these data types without creating a new object. For example, 
if you have a list l = [1, 2, 3], you can do l[0] = 4 to change it to [4, 2, 3]
