looping statements:
for loop: It is used whenever we need to execute statements repeatedly
syntax: 
		for val in variable:
		      print(val)
example:
list:
1.	      fruits = [“apple”, “cherry”, “orange”]
		for fruit in fruits:
		     print(fruit)
2.	      fruits = [“apple”, “cherry”, “orange”]
		for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
		     print(f”Index: {index}, Fruits: {fruit})
3.	      for num in range(1,5):
     print(num)
Dictionary:
emp_data = {
	“id”: 1111,
	“name”: “aaaa”
	“company name”: “sapiens”,
	“domain”: [“developer”, “devops”, “tester”]
}
To get only keys elements
for key in emp_data.keys():
	print(key)
to get values from dictionay
for val in emp_data.values():
	print(val)
To get both key and value from dictionary
for key, val in emp_data.items():
	print(f“{key}:{val}”)
